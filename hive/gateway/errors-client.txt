This error can occur if you're trying to cancel the generation of an account status report for declarative policies that already has the complete, cancelled, or error status. Cancelation is only possible for reports with a running status. This error can also occur when you're trying to get a summary for a report that has not yet reached the completed status. This error can also occur if you start report generation while another report is being generated. Only one report per organization can be generated at a time. For more information, see Generating the account status report for declarative policies.

RequestResourceCountExceeded 	

Details in your Spot request exceed the numbers allowed by the Spot service in one of the following ways, depending on the action that generated the error:

—If you get this error when you submitted a request for Spot Instances, check the number of Spot Instances specified in your request. The number shouldn't exceed the 3,000 maximum allowed per request. Resend your Spot Instance request and specify a number less than 3,000. If your account's regional Spot request limit is greater than 3,000 instances, you can access these instances by submitting multiple smaller requests.

—If you get this error when you sent Describe Spot Instance requests, check the number of requests for Spot Instance data, the amount of data you requested, and how often you sent the request. The frequency with which you requested the data combined with the amount of data exceeds the levels allowed by the Spot service. Try again and submit fewer large Describe requests over longer intervals.

This limit is separate from your individual resource limit. If you get this error, break up your request into smaller requests; for example, if you are launching 15 instances, try launching 5 instances in 3 separate requests.
