You might not be authorized to carry out the request; for example, trying to associate an Elastic IP address that is not yours, or trying to use an AMI for which you do not have permissions. Ensure that your account is authorized to use Amazon EC2, that your credit card details are correct, and that you are using the correct credentials.
Blocked 	Your account is currently blocked. Contact Support if you have questions.
DryRunOperation 	The user has the required permissions, so the request would have succeeded, but the DryRun parameter was used.

If you're using temporary security credentials, this error can also occur if the credentials have expired. For more information, see Temporary security credentials in the IAM User Guide.
TagPolicyViolation 	You attempted to create or update a resource with tags that are not compliant with the tag policy requirements for this account. For more information, see Grant permission to tag resources during creation.
